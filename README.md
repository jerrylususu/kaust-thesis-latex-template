## Modifications
1. Fix the indentation of Table of Content entries (Subsections should not be indented separately, and they can continue under main sections.)
2. Add the entry of Table of Content into Table of Content
3. Remove the dot in the header of Acknowledgements
4. Fix links in Table of Contents, and now they can jump to the correct pages. (Examination Committee Page, Copyright, Abstract, Acknowledgements, Table of Contents.)

## Usage
Upload to Overleaf, and it should just work. (Tested using Compiler pdfLaTeX, Tex Live version 2021.)
