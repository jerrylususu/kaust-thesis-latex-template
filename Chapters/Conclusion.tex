\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

\section{Summary}

The author must provide an overall summary and discussion of the significance of the work. If the dissertation or thesis consists of relatively independent chapters, a unifying summary should be included at the end or beginning of the dissertation or thesis. Such a summary will be significantly more expansive than the abstract.

\section{Bibliography (or References or Works Cited)}

As a page heading, use "BIBLIOGRAPHY" (or "REFERENCES" or "WORKS CITED") all in capital letters centered on the page. Always start a new page. Bibliographies may be single-spaced within each entry but must include 24 points of space between entries. It is recommended that you follow the standard citation format used by a major journal in your academic field and that the style be consistent throughout the dissertation or thesis.

\section{References}

The precise form of a bibliography or reference section can conform to the style current in the thesis or dissertation writer's discipline, but this form must be employed consistently throughout the thesis. All material already published must be reformatted into the guidelines specified here and pagination and bibliographic style should be consistent with the remainder of the document. For MS Word users, the EndNote citation management software can be utilized as a referencing tool. It is available for download by KAUST students via the KAUST Library website.
